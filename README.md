This is an excel spreadsheet for determining the signal to noise ratio for a star imaged by a telescope.
It assumes a broad spectral response similar to the Gaia G filter and a typical silicon CCD or CMOS camera.
You enter in the star magnitude, the seeing FWHM, and the sky background in magnitude per square arc sec, and your aperture.
The camera noise values are provided. Enter also the exposure time and number of subs and it gives you the SNR 
photometrically for the measurement of the brightness of that star. SNR of 6 or higher represents a reliably detectable object.
SNR of 3 is the threshold of maybe detectability.
